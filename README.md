QuickVote -- a BackBone tutorial app
====================================

This is a simple application to use for a backbone tutorial: a poll
application, that allows you to create polls, choices, and (eventually) to vote
on them.  The voting part is left as an in-class activity.

The app defines two routes, and has several sub-views for the poll detail page.
It has enough complexity to hopefully provide a good example for how to think
about architecting backbone.js app, but not so much complexity that beginners
will be totally lost.
