History: Client vs Server
=========================

In the beginning, there was the mainframe.

1970's: Time shares, dumb terminals. Room-filling servers.

1980's: Personal computers, back to the client.

1990's: The Internet: back to the server.

2000's: People start taking javascript seriously.

2010's: The "single page app": back to the client.

Web browsers
============

1990: Nexus
1992: Mosaic (first with images)
1994: Opera v1
1994: Mosaic Netscape / Netscape Navigator
1995: Internet Explorer v1
1996-2000: Browser Wars I, Netscape vs IE
2003: Firefox, Safari
2003-2007: Browser Wars II, Everyone vs IE
2006: (Initial jQuery release)
2007: iPhone (first "real" mobile browser with wide market share)
2008: Chrome
2013:
 - IE10, Firefox 19, Chrome 24
 - Opera is moving to "webkit"
 - Mobile is huge, but hugely webkit.

201?:
 - FirefoxOS?
 - ChromeOS?

javascript & libraries
======================

In the dark ages: incompatible browser implementations.
Today: mostly better.

Libraries smooth over remaining differences.

In 2007:
 - jQuery vs prototype vs dojo vs mochikit
Today:
 - jQuery, or jQuery-compatible things like "Zepto"

client-side MVC
===============

 - It is today's "2007" in client-side MVC. Lots of choices, no clear winner,
   lots of opinions.
 - Given the complexity of full MVC frameworks, there may never be "one true
   library" (just like today there is Django, Flask, Pyramid, Tornado, ...)

Major players:
 - Angular.js
 - Ember.js
 - Backbone.js

More radical:
 - Meteor.js
 - Derby.js


Backbone
========

Why backbone?
 - Widely used (github followers, google page volume, major projects in production)
 - Simpler/less opinionated (easier to plug in, wrap head around)
 - Fairly stable (at 1.0 release candidate stage)
Why not backbone?
 - More verbose

Models, Views, Routers, Templates.
==================================

Events
 - on, trigger, once

Models:
 - "get", "set", "fetch", "save"

Views:
 - "events", "el", "$", "render"

Underscore templates
 - <%- "escaped" %>, <%= "unescaped" %>
 - <% var interpreted = true; %>
